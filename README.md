# Elementor Posts Filter

This widget, used in combination with the Elementor Post widget, gives you the same live filtering bar the Portfolio widget has.

The widget has 3 options:
* `CSS ID` needs to be set with the ID of the Posts widget you want to give the filter bar to
* `taxonomy` is the taxonomy you want to use as a filter. Make sure the taxonomy is used by the posts shown in the Posts widget.
* `Show all text` just in case you need something different from "All"

You can also style this widget the same way you would do for a Filter Bar in the Portfolio widget.
